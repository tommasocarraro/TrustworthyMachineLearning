In order to guarantee DP, this bound should be selected independently of the actual data at hand. (Mechanisms that do not require such an a priori bound exist, but are more complicated.

It is possible to observe that with the increase of the number of databases the difference between the true expected value (expected value of the balances without the adding of the noise) and the expected value on the noisy data (expected value of the balances with the adding of the noise) decreases. This means that with the increase of the number of databases the noise becomes less effective (original data are very similar to noisy data) and the privacy of the users is reduced, so it is more difficult to guarantee differential privacy.\n"

Use the data in \"balances.csv\" loaded below, and release $x$ (the age) and $y$ (the bank account balance) using Laplace mechanism with total privacy loss $\\epsilon=1$ and fit the regression model to the noisy data. Repeat the process 100 times and evaluate how the model compares with one learned from clean data. Because you are releasing the composition of two queries, you will need to use $\\epsilon/2$ as the $\\epsilon$ for each query to reach total privacy loss of $\\epsilon$.\n",

Design a two-step protocol that first estimates the means $\\bar{x}$ and $\\bar{y}$, and then uses these to release the terms $(x_i - \\bar{x}) (y_i - \\bar{y})$, $(x_i - \\bar{x})^2$ using the Laplace mechanism. Fit the regression model using the noisy information. Compare with the above. In order to make the results comparable, the total privacy loss should be $\\epsilon=1$. Because you are releasing the composition of four queries, you will need to use $\\epsilon/4$ as the $\\epsilon$ for each query to reach total privacy loss of $\\epsilon$.\n",

        "The code for the tasks is available in the two following cells. These are my considerations on the results obtained:\n",
        "\n",
        "i) It is possible to observe from the results that the model fitted on noisy data (model fitted on x and y after the introduction of noise) is highly distorted from the model fitted on the original data (data without the adding of noise) giving privacy to the users in the dataset. In fact, it is possible to observe that the difference between the two computed MSE (MSE of the model trained on original data and MSE of the model trained on noisy data) is really big (the MSE of these two models have been computed on the original data to make a good comparision). After that it is possible to observe that with the increase of the value of the $\\epsilon$ parameter the difference between the two MSE becomes smaller. This is due to the fact that increasing the value of $\\epsilon$ we decrease the privacy of the users in the dataset because we introduce less noise on the data allowing the model fitted on the noisy data to become similar to the model fitted on the original data. Finally, it is possible to observe this behavior from the graphs I've displayed. On the left one it is possible to see that due to the small $\\epsilon$ value the lines computed by the two models (true and noisy model) are really different, while in the right one it is possible to see that the lines are closer and this is due to the higher $\\epsilon$ value.\n",
        "\n",
        "ii) For this question the answer is similar to the previous one. It is possible to observe that with $\\epsilon=1$ the difference between the MSE of the model fitted in the original data and the MSE of the model fitted on noisy data is really high. Then, it is possible to observe that with the increase of the value of $\\epsilon$ we reduce the privacy for the users in the dataset, like in the previous answer, but since we are adding noise in two step (more noise compared to the previous answer) with $\\epsilon=10$ we don't loose a huge amount of privacy like in the previous case (from the second graph it is possible to see that with $\\epsilon=10$ the model fitted on noisy data is still very different from the model fitted on the original data). The biggest difference between the two answers is that since we add noise in two steps, with the same value of $\\epsilon$ we obtain a stronger privacy guarantee in this case. It is possible to compare the graphs of the previous answer with the graphs of this answer to see that with the same value of $\\epsilon$ the difference between the MSEs is higher in this case and this means that we loose less privacy even if we are using the same value of $\\epsilon$. This is due to the fact that we add more noise compared to the previous case.\n",
        "\n",
        "iii) The answer to this question has been given in the previous answers."
